# The `concurrency` key ensures that only a single workflow in the same concurrency group will run at the same time. 
# For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency)."
# `concurrency.group` generates a concurrency group name from the workflow name and repository name. 
# The `||` operator is used to define fallback values.
